# Shehryar Suleman Summer 2021 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge 

The following is what the application is capable of doing:
1. Add one or bulk images
2. Delete one or bulk images
3. User permissions
4. Login existing user
5. Register new user
6. Secure uploading of image using the s3 bucket

The application only has the backend setup for now since the challenge did not require a frontend component, but a barebones react Frontend is there and could be easily changed. I would have created a fancy frontend, but talking to Shopify representatives, a Frontend component for a the backend challenge was not needed, so I just focused on the backend.
